On one hand, errors in brewing can ruin the quality of coffee, producing a less than enjoyable cup – wasting the time and money that went into brewing it. On the other hand, if you are armed with the proper tools and information, you can tweak brewing recipes to highlight the best aspects of the coffee and tailor it exactly to your preferences.
